Local Sync is a local-only process by which users may choose to save images and/or videos to their local device in order to speed Vault loading.
This is the current structure upon which it rests/

{
    ... 
    /FileSystem.documentDirectory {
    ...
    LocalConfig.txt: {
        contents: {
            const localConfig = {
                syncPreference: "Partial",
            };
            (use JSON.parse() to read, JSON.stringify() to write)
        },
    },
    /LocalSync: {
        ... (image and video files named as they are in AWS S3 [DynamoDB/Posts/contentkey] - file extension already included)
        contentkey
    }

}
}
