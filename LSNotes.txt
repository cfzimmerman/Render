Local Sync (LS) is a local-only process by which users may choose to save images and/or videos to their local device in order to speed Vault loading.
Later addition: Local Sync (LS) also now encompasses some non-optional user data storage (ex. Notifications cache). This holds the LS label to clarify all functions that utilize the DocumentDirectory, but it's not affected by LocalSyncSettings or LS opt out
This is the current structure upon which it functions.

Local Sync Constituents:
/profile
    • LocalSyncSettings.tsx
    • LSAddItem.ts
    • LSChangeConfig.ts
    • LSClearStorage.ts
    • LSGetConfig.ts
    • LSRemoveItem.ts
    • LSRewriteLocalLibrary.ts

/homevault (not-optional)
    • LSCreateNotificationStore.ts
    • LSGetNotificationStore.ts
    • LSUpdateNotificationStore.ts


File path:
{
    ... 
    /FileSystem.documentDirectory {
        ...
        LocalConfig.txt: {
            contents: {
                const localConfig = {
                    syncPreference: "Partial",
                };
                (use JSON.parse() to read, JSON.stringify() to write)
            },
        },
        LocalLibrary.txt: {
            contents: {
                const localLibrary = {
                    "contentkey.png": {
                        lastUpdated: 2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z (ISO 8061 date)
                    },
                    ...
                }
            }
        },
        /LocalSync: {
            ... (image and video files named as they are in AWS S3 [DynamoDB/Posts/contentkey] - file extension already included)
            contentkey
        },
        NotificationStore.txt: {
            contents: {
                const notificationStore = {
                    unreadCutoffDate: 2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z (ISO 8061 date),
                    notificationData: [] array of type NotificationDataItem (./src/screens.tabnav/homevault/NotificationLibrary.ts)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

* Note 1, the contents: {} wrapper is purely for organizing the documentation examples. documentDirectory/contents isn't a route in use. Maybe that's confusing, but the nested const exampleField = {} below is probably worse, so just deal with it 😘
** Note 2, in LocalLibrary.txt, contentkey includes a "." for the file extension. Object must be read using contents["imgname.png"] syntax.
