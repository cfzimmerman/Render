Local Sync (LS) is a local-only process by which users may choose to save images and/or videos to their local device in order to speed Vault loading.
This is the current structure upon which it functions.

Local Sync Constituents:
/profile
    â€¢ LocalSyncSettings.tsx
    â€¢ LSGetConfig.ts
    â€¢ LSChangeConfig.ts
    â€¢ LSClearStorage.ts
    â€¢ 

File path:
{
    ... 
    /FileSystem.documentDirectory {
        ...
        LocalConfig.txt: {
            contents: {
                const localConfig = {
                    syncPreference: "Partial",
                };
                (use JSON.parse() to read, JSON.stringify() to write)
            },
        },
        LocalLibrary.txt: {
            contents: {
                const localLibrary = {
                    "contentkey.png": {
                        lastUpdated: 2011-10-05T14:48:00.000Z (ISO 8061 date)
                    },
                    ...
                }
            }
        },
        /LocalSync: {
            ... (image and video files named as they are in AWS S3 [DynamoDB/Posts/contentkey] - file extension already included)
            contentkey
        }
    }
}

* Note 1, the contents: {} wrapper is purely for organizing the documentation examples. documentDirectory/contents isn't a route in use. Maybe that's confusing, but the nested const exampleField = {} below is probably worse, so just deal with it ðŸ˜˜
** Note 2, in LocalLibrary.txt, contentkey includes a "." for the file extension. Object must be read using contents["imgname.png"] syntax.
