# Render

[Demo](https://youtu.be/fp9qIQecDdw)

This was the main repo for Render, the mobile app I made in 2022. I learned by program because of this project and spent nearly seven full time months with it. Because it was my intro to programming, the codebase is mostly spaghetti code. However, it still holds a warm place in my heart. 
Without Render, I would not be a software engineer today.
